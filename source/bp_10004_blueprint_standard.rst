Blueprint Standard
==================

Introduction
------------
All features intended to be implemented are tracked on GITHUB. Each functional requirement has a proposal a "blueprint", and it can be a single paragraph placeholder for the idea, or full blown development specification.

Purpose
~~~~~~~
The purpose of this document is to define a standard blueprints. However all blueprints are working documents.

Objective and Scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This document covers only covers the formatting and layout for Blueprints.

Formatting
----------
All blueprints will be defined in RST Format so that the documentation can be viewed 
as plain text editors or Sphinx-Doc and exported to other format such as PDF.

reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation.

Layout
------

Each blueprint must remain a single RST file with headings as follows:

   * Introduction
      * Purpose
      * Objective and Scope
   * Example1.
   * Example2.
   * References.
   * Author.
